/// <reference types="cypress" />

// Welcome to Cypress!
//
// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:
// https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress

describe('Homepage football app', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      // Cypress starts out with a blank slate for each test
      // so we must tell it to visit our website with the `cy.visit()` command.
      // Since we want to visit the same URL at the start of all our tests,
      // we include it in our beforeEach function so that it runs before each test
      cy.visit('https://football-app-login.web.app/')
    })

    it('Verify Homepage functionality', () => {    
        // We can go even further and check that the default todos each contain
        // the correct text. We use the `first` and `last` functions
        // to get just the first and last matched elements individually,
        // and then perform an assertion with `should`.
        cy.get('#root > div > div > div > a').should('have.text', 'Get Started')
